Junru Lu's plot (lj1230)
![Alt text]('https://github.com/LuJunru/PUI2018_lj1230/blob/master/HW8_lj1230/plot.png')

That's a very clear plot you've created. There is no distracting element, and choosing a scatter plot 
doesn't lead to any kind of distortion or misrepresentation of the data. It may help to reduce the size
of the titles and axis labels, and maybe shorten the title too, since you're repeating most of that
information in the comment below. Also, there is a space missing between the population and bracket
symbol in both the axes labels.
A couple comments on the plot itself:
I would have maybe changed the colors of those PUMA areas which have a significantly low or high unemployment
RATE. This would be interesting to see.
 A couple comments on the plot itself (suggestions for improvement)
- PUMA data is inherently geographic, and hence plotting this on a map would have been more helpful
- The plot doesn't show unemployment rate, but just the total unemployed population, so perhaps showing
the unemployment rate would be more beneficial to someone looking at this chart. This added to a map 
would definitely provide more insights.
 Thanks,
Shivam


I couldn't find Robert Cacharani's (rpc294) plot on his github repo.
