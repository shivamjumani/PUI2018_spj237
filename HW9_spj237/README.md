# Assignment 1
I commented on Junru Lu's plot (and sent a pull request), however I couldn't find Robert Cacharani's plot in his repository, so couldn't comment on that.

# Assignment 2
I worked on this assignment on my own. Used Dr. Bianco's assignment 2 notebook as a skeleton for my work, and referred to the gender bias notebook as well as the line and residuals notebook as a reference.

# Assignment 3
I worked on this assignment on my own, using the same references mentioned above (assignment 2). I was unable to successfully plot the WLS line, or change the color of the US point, but I'm looking forward to learning what my mistake is.
