Figure 1: The plot above is showing the growth of breweries, wineries, and distilleries in New York State between 1990 and 2018. In recent years, the craft beverage industry in USA has grown significantly, and a large portion of that can be attributed to the incentives that states have introduced to support this industry, especially New York. New York introduced the Farm Winery Act in 1976, which allowed small wineries to directly supply to consumers and retailers, instead of just selling to wholesalers. According the plot, the wineries started to increase substantially only after 2000, and has been on a steady rise since. In 2012, similar legislation and many financial incentives were passes to encompass craft breweries and distilleries as well, to support the growth of these establishments. This growth is reflected in the plot, which indicates a drastic increase in breweries and distilleries after 2012. Wineries that once dominated the craft industry in New York, has recently been surpassed by breweries, which have almost quintupled between 2013 and today.
